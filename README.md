# Lightning Kube

Lightning Kube provides a simple way to deploy a Lightning Node into Kubernetes.

This project implements a Lightning Node running in Kubernetes using Lightning Network Daemon (LND) and BTCD deployed by Jenkins X. 

- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home) is a container management system. If a project is [Dockerized](https://www.docker.com) Kubernetes simplifies your project lifecycle.
- [Lightning Network Daemon (LND)](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd) is a complete implementation of a Lightning Network node.
- [BTCD](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd) is an implementation of a full bitcoin node written in Go.
- [Jenkins X](https://jenkins-x.io) is a CI/CD solution for applications on Kubernetes.

LND currently requires a connection to a full bitcoin node if you want your Lightning Node to run on mainnet. Lightning Kube consists of the following Kubernetes/Jenkins X ready projects:

- [Lightning Kube LND](https://github.com/kevinstl/lightning-kube-lnd)
- [Lightning Kube BTCD](https://github.com/kevinstl/lightning-kube-btcd)

If you do not currently have and instance of Kubernetes an excellent place to start is to deploy it locally with [Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube). A new installation of Jenkins X will offer to install Minikube for you but you may want to give [Minikube Easy](https://github.com/kevinstl/minikube-easy) a look as it can simplify and enhance your Minikube installation. Once your ready to run your Lighting Node on mainnet [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/) is an easy to use cloud based Kubernetes Cluster.

This project itself is actually a Kubernetes/Jenkins X ready implementation of [Markserv](https://github.com/markserv/markserv) to allow for real time github style rendering and editing of this README.md file locally. Deploying this project to your own Kubernetes instance would be a simple way to get acquainted with Kubernetes and Jenkins X. There is probably no reason to deploy this project to a production environment. It is intended strictly for learning purposes. If you are already familiar with kubernetes and Jenkins X or just want to get going now then you can move on to installing [Lightning Kube LND](https://github.com/kevinstl/lightning-kube-lnd) and [Lightning Kube BTCD](https://github.com/kevinstl/lightning-kube-btcd).

To install this project:

1. Stand up a [Kubernetes Cluster and Install Jenkins X](https://github.com/kevinstl/minikube-easy#preparing-for-installations).
2. Make the directory to hold this project in you home directory: `mkdir -p /Developer/projects` Your installation of this project will look for this directory. If you need to change it the modification can be made in [deployment.yaml](https://github.com/kevinstl/lightning-kube/blob/master/charts/lightning-kube/templates/deployment.yaml) 
3. Clone this project. `git clone https://github.com/kevinstl/lightning-kube ~/Developer/projects/lightning-kube`
4. Change to project directory `cd ~/Developer/projects/lightning-kube`
5. Import this project into your Jenkins X instance. `jx import`

If the installation is successful and you installed via Minikube Easy then Jenkins X should have deployed this [README.md](http://minikube-easy:30801/lightning-kube/README.md) into your kubernetes cluster.
